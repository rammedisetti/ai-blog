# AI Blog

A simple Django-based blog project.

## Signup Feature

The project now includes a minimal signup page where users can create an account
with a unique username and email. Passwords are validated using Django's default
password validators and are securely hashed.

## Login Feature

A lightweight login page lets existing users sign in with their username or
email address and password. After authenticating, users are redirected to the
homepage.
